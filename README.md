# beam-up
Programs to transport matter.

This repo is for programs that will answer the question of beaming matter at light speed.
Use any language, but one folder per language please, to solve the problem of beaming matter, maybe Star Trek style.
Assume there are transuders that can take a digital signal and convert it to matter and from matter to a digital signal. Write the code that makes all this work. Whatever you think we would need. This is open source science.
